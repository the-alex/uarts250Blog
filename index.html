                    <p>I like to think of myself as a "Good Nerd", and while this is a term that I defined myself, I don't like to think of myself as the greatest example of a "Good Nerd". Waleed Kahn and David Snyder are some of the best "Good Nerds" I know. But that is a topic for another post.</p>

                    <p>Part of being a Good Nerd is staying on top of tech related news- news relevant to my field. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Evernote, Tesla- I read news about these organizations all the time. I could tell you their company story, business models, how different communities perceive them, their technology stacks, but most importantly, their CEOs.</p>

                    <p>Occasionally, they'll give an interview with a media outlet I frequent and I'll get a glimpse into their psyche. I'm scanning for hints at an answer to a common question that has yet to be answered. "What makes us happy? Can I be happy? What do I have to be happy?" It's these CEOs that I've presumed who have figured it out. They work harder than anyone else and succeed where others fail. Surely they must know something I don't. </p>

                    <p>Bill Gates convinced IBM to let him demo windows before even having it developed. He built the prototype in intervening three weeks. The CEO of Evernote, Phil Libin, once said in an interview, "If I'm not working on something 16 hours a day and upset that I can't work 18, I don't want to work on that product." Recently, Elon Musk was the commencement speaker for USC's Marshall Business School. In his speech, he said, and I'll lightly paraphrase for the sake of brevity, "You've got to work super hard ... When my brother and I were starting out first company we didn't get an apartment, we just got a tiny office space and a couch ... You've got to work hard. Like, every waking hour."</p>

                    <p>They weren't all born geniuses- that's an argument riddled with fallacies. What separates them from us? Why aren't we all like them?</p>

                    <p>It certainly seems relieving to believe that I'm made happy not by work and productivity, but by a hammock on the coast of Hawaii, but there's some part of me that doubts that. </p>

                    <p>There are a number of possible reasons these individual business people seem to gravitate towards high work, high stress positions. They probably weren't just born geniuses, but they might have been born to be excited exclusively by achievement and work ethic. </p>

                    <p>I hear from these people of achievement and work ethic. They all seem endlessly happy with their work. The dissatisfaction that comes from knowing what I can do and what I have done is fails to halt. The responsibility gives them purpose, and fulfilling that grand purpose gives them great satisfaction. These are people who will never have that problem, because when they realized they could do something, they got up and started doing it. Without hesitation or halting. For years. And when they finished and took a step back at their work completed, I can't possibly synthesize the feeling they must have felt.</p>

                    <p>"They were just born that way. They're only satisfied by silly amounts of work ethic and achievement." I doubt that they were just born that way. 'Cognitively wired for success'- the argument brushes Social Darwinism and encourages meritocratic ideas of human worth.</p>

                    <p>"Their definition of happiness seems exclusively tied to achievement. If you simply adjust your concept of what makes you happy and learn to be content with what you have, you'll cease this feeling of unhappiness." But I'll always know what I could have done, and speculate about how it must have felt. </p>

                    <p>"By this definition, you may never finish! You could conceivably always work, never achieving satisfaction or true happiness." But at least I touched more lives than those who sat idle. </p>

                    <p>As I type this at 7:42 on a Saturday evening in the Computer Science and Engineering building, I see graduate students coming in and out of the pantry. They fill water bottles and grab a Pop Tart or Nutri-Grain bar and head back to their offices. I often wonder if their always here. I wonder if they're the next great CEO. I wonder if they're always working. Why aren't I always working?</p>

                    <p>I want to be a Better Nerd. I think I'll start today.</p>

                    <p>
                        I have been very fortunate to have been parented in part by Nicholas Johns. Nick is responsible for many aspects of my personality or life values that I find both constructive and positive to my being. In fewer words, I owe much of who I am today to Nick.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Among many things, he taught me to understand the potential of all human beings and the joy in the pursuit of knowledge. However, I am most maybe most grateful that Nick allowed me a vast amount of freedom. Freedom that allowed me to experiment with interests, hobbies, and fundamentally my own personality. I was allowed the freedom to find out who I wanted to be. Nick saw his role as a guide to facilitate me to be that person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consequently I was given the freedom to do things that I see few other individuals my age have done. I don't know of another father who would allow their fourteen year old son (with little to no financial experience) to invest in volatile "Penny Stocks".
                    </p>

                    <p>I'm not sure why he started, but Nick began 'day trading' around the beginning of my freshman year of high school. He had made a hobby of hunting down stocks that had a high daily volatility with a very low price per share. His end goal with an investment, as hinted by the name, was to invest and divest in the same day for a relatively sound return on investment (ROI). Since the cost of a trade (buy or sell) on Scottrade was $7, the revenue generated by the sale only needed to be greater than $14 total for a positive ROI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I remember Nick explaining this to me one afternoon and being fascinated. I asked him what companies he was following and quickly tapped their names into the native notepad app on my phone and later into google. I wanted to know the "story" of each company. Who was their CEO? What else have they done? Who is their primary investor? What's their product? Is it well received? There was a narrative thread that each company had, and some of them overlapped.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Through conversation, Nick eventually offered me a small fund to invest in my own portfolio. I asked if he had any tips for me, and he offered this string in return. "Low cap, bio-pharmaceutical companies". And with that, I had my target portfolio.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before we go any further, I'd like to draw attention to some of the restrictions I was facing being a student trader in high school in 2010.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The trading day started at 9:30 am and ended at 4:00 pm, Monday through Friday.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    School began at 7:33am and ended at 2:15, Monday through Friday.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The primary method of trading was on a mobile phone.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Phones were confiscated on sight.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        There was the occasional teacher who allowed students to have phones out in their class. More prevalent was the teacher who wouldn't notice me tapping away under the desk. However, the threat of having my phone confiscated in the middle of a turbulent trading day was all too real, so I took special precautions to limit the screen's exposure to the classroom. So with a firm understanding of the obstacles ahead, I set out to build my portfolio.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It turns out that the two hottest sectors of bio-pharm are cancer treatment and weight loss, with the latter of the two seeing the most progress (go figure). Companies like EntroMedics Inc., Vivus, and Arena Pharmaceutical all had drugs or treatments in clinical phase trials said to facilitate weight loss with minimal effort. But there were obvious problems with each.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Arena was trying to get it's amphetamine based Lorcaserin approved against the general medical conciseness of "Amphetamines are bad" and eventually pivoted with a new drug called "Belviq". EntroMedics had some weird hardware that proposed to zap the fat away, and Vivus was attempting what Arena was doing with another amphetamine based drug, but apparently succeeding anyway.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's one key observation to make about these companies. Not only were they in a hot sector of the bio-pharm market, they all had absolutely zero dollars in revenue. The value of these companies was purely speculative, based primarily on the likelihood of FDA approval. This principle gives way to two easily recognizable trends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first: the dates of the clinical trials and FDA verdict were publicly available, so speculation would cause the value of the company to rise in anticipation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second: trading days near the midpoint between clinical trial result dates yield the lowest volatility, and therefore the highest predictability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These two facts encourage two ways to play the bio-pharm game. Either buy low in anticipation of the speculation that occurs before a clinical trial report or FDA verdict, or buy around the average lower bound for the share price in the last week and sell as soon as the ROI covers the trade cost ($14 in my case).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The latter of the two strategies embodied the "Day Trader" mentality, which I found more entertaining. It forced me to pay attention to the stories of the companies I followed, which was far more engaging than waiting around for speculation on a stock to begin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a few months, I had nearly doubled my fund trading once every few days. I might have traded more frequently, but SEC restrictions prevented true day trading in accounts with less than $25k of capital. I felt like the experiment had been a success. Truly anyone of relative intelligence could prosper in this area of the financial game ...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I invite you to recall the restrictions enumerated above.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was one class I couldn't manage to trade in. My third period physical science class started around 9:30 am and the market had been rallying around ARNA in anticipation of Lorcaserin's approval. I had broken one of my own rules in buying during this time with the plan to sell directly before the approval. As I recall (possibly falsely), I mistook the date of the verdict for the next day. So during this class the price of ARNA fell by about 58%, tanking the value of my portfolio.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I admitted defeat, at least for the short term. To be an affective day trader required an attention I just couldn't give in my high school years. I have since effectively postponed my self employed day trading career, putting it on the back burner as a plan C if my careers as both a programmer and street drummer fail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I see myself returning to the stock market someday, though I often wonder if the future of trading will have a place for the day trader. I'll save that thought for another post.

                        <br> Its dangerous in that way,
                        <br> because another distraction
                        <br> is a possible reaction

                        <br> the flames dance until I jump to put them out.
                        <br> I worry that if I'm not always hurrying towards the end of my life
                        <br> my life might end.

                        <br> I know love what I do but I think I love people more.
                        <br> I love the rhymes they speak-
                        <br> The lows and highs-
                        <br> its the peaks that stick out to me.
                        <br> The crecendo in their voices
                        <br> the melody in their emotions-
                        <br> I'm drawn to my friends out of raw desire
                        <br> until the fire is lit under me
                        <br> and it's all down to the wire
                        <br> once again
                        <br> ... until I can break free.

                        <br> another all nighter
                        <br> and while that may seem extreme
                        <br> so would the habits I've held
                        <br> that help me blow off steam.
                        <br> I'm a three beer queer so long as there isn't a fourth nearby.
                        <br>
                        <br> Work hard play hard, right?
                        <br> Always the extremes-
                        <br> my life seems to play this theme
                        <br> over and over
                        <br> as if I fail to see the four leaf clovers surrounding the black cat that distracts-
                        <br> she struts on by me like she was placed here
                        <br> to make me fear
                        <br> that I was going to fail
                        <br> right then and there-
                        <br> that if I wasn't in the library while another student was,
                        <br> all blame is deserved and fair.
                        <br> I think I need to a little bit more aware.
                        <br>
                        <br> I think what I need to accept that there will always be the option for escape-
                        <br> and that I'll always want for it.
                        <br>
                        <br> Whether it be in the rhythm of my drums
                        <br> or the melody of my loved ones-
                        <br> there will always be a time and place for these extremes.
                        <br> The doubt that I'm working hard enough
                        <br> and the worry that I'm not living enough.
                        <br>
                        <br> But what would be a life without both?
                        <br> I tend to forget-
                        <br> a life without contrast once
                        <br> and the recent past came to blast
                        <br> the mast and my sails whole sale
                        <br>off the USS "easy living"
                        <br> and I realized that once again ... I'm just not satisfied anymore.
                        <br>
                        <br> And while it may seem from my verbose description
                        <br> that I've headed the warnings of past inscriptions
                        <br> I still find myself brushing against these ancient spectors.

This resolution is mostly unrelated to the date- I know I've needed to begin extolling my knowledge from books again since Thanksgiving when I had a conversation with my step-father and his twin brother. Nick and Mark are intellectuals of the highest order- the type that deflect the title of genius with remarks like, "No, it's just our work ethic" and "I didn't invent calculus, I'm just good at it".

                        I think after hearing these lines for years I've come to believe their "work ethic" explanation. The concept is something that's caused a bit of dissonance inside me since it's inception, but I'll walk you through the philosophy.

                        Pretty simple, right? Well, honestly, it's too simple. I had an disscussion turned disagreement turned argument with my step-mother that statement. You see, I believe that when we're in our early stages of learning, there's a lot of hand holding and soft gentle padding on the back when we fail to understand things. This is especially apparent in math. Many people encounter difficulty in that subject, as it can be counter intuitive and hard to map operations in math to things in the real world.

                    <p>
                        Counting apples is easy, but phase shifting a wave is a little more abstract. The problem comes when students are told this- "Some people are just better at this stuff than you." The catostrophic damage comes when that student finally says casually, "I'm just not good at math."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Woah, woah, woah. Back up. This is unacceptable. I will tell you right now. No one is bad at math. No one is bad at anything. And anyone can achieve everything. It's a matter of work ethic. I swear. I consider myself an example. Hear me out, and prepare to learn something.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My stepmother was not a fan of hearing this all encompassing philosophy. "That's ridiculous- I would study economics in college for hours and hours and get nothign from it!" she argued. "True!", I returned. "But the series of events that prevented you from understanding economics started later than birth and sooner than the start of that class." And now for some conjecture supported by my experience with my stepmother.

                        It was in middle school, when she encountered the first difficult courses in her acadmeic career. There, when you failed and saw other succeed, she assumed it was because they were "smarter" than her. They just "got it" faster than she did. But what many students fail to realize is that if they rise to the challenge and see that understanding maths is a tangible goal early on, then they'll be less likely to give up as the maths get harder. You'll have forced yourself to understand exactly what your doing before you move on.

                        I think I'm tangenting too much, so I'll skip to the point. My argument with my stepmother forced me to rephrase my point into a less conscise, but seemingly more accurate phrase.

                        I like to use the example of Edina Public High School, because it's where my stepfather went and their statistics are public. The school is very well funded and the teachers there have a unfied mission: all of our students are capable of going to the top teir of colleges in America.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And they're correct. Or at least they have been for the last fifty years. Class after class, these students go to the Ivy Leauges, the great public schools like Michigan, Virginia, and the UC system- as well as all manner of other incredible universities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <i>"How are they able to do this!? Surely they must kick students who do poorly out to boost they're nunbers!"</i> - Nope. It's a public school. You can go there if you wish- for free.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <i>"It must be the funding! Edina is so wealthy- they must get special treatment of some kind to make them smart!"</i> - you're getting close, but you're proving my point. Given the correct environment, a student can demonstrate ability many people would percieve as "Genius" level. However, the school isn't spending money on iPads- and even if they were, they don't help. They just make getting school supplies slightly convenient. No, the real advancement comes from one simple place: the school's standard.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Every student is told they are capable of greatness, <i>and are then held to that standard.</i> This is what happened to me when I met my stepfather, Nick. He was the first to tell me that math wasn't hard. That anyone can do anything. That he himself, smart as he may seem (BS in Electrical Engineering and MS in Patent Law from NYU) wasn't a genius, but it was exclusively this standard that elevated him. It's all a matter of how much you want it- how much time you're willing to spend to reflect and improve on yourself.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Nick said I was better than a C student. So he asked me to try and get straight A's. I tried, and tried, and tried. In 9th grade, I studied for hours every night- making sure I understood the symbols on the page and the systems at play. I spent days reviewing for exams weeks ahead of time. I even remember one summer I worked every day to fill up the pages of an algebra 2 workbook because I knew I needed to master that before I went on to Trigonometry and Calculus. In order to avoid the community college I believed I was predestined for and make it to Michigan (and equally prestigious institutions of computer science) I needed to progress from my 1300 combined SAT score and get my GPA from the middle of the class to the top 90% of students who took the SAT and the top 8% of my school.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sure enough, in three years of working- I achieved that. A 2170 on the SAT, a GPA of 3.8, and an acceptance letter to the University of Michigan.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I saw that all it took was work ethic that I didn't know I was capable of- that many people don't realize they have. I've carried this into college, and year after year, as subjects get harder and the worlkload grows, I grow with it to meet the challenge. Becasue I know that if I get a B, it's not because I can't. It's because while I was in the arboritum, someone else was in the library. While I was watching television, someone else was starting the project. It's becasue someone was working harder than I was.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But naturally, there is a small problem. Everytime I fail, the answer for why is clear and the blame is pointed squarly at myself. The harsh reality of my philosophy is that if I fail, it's because I didn't want it enough. I made the wrong descisions. I recieved a C in EECS 281- one of the more difficult classes in the Computer Science major, and I blamed myself- and I was correct to do so. When my roommates threw parties, I'd want to be there. If a pretty girl was going to go out to dinner alone, I accompanied her. I still can't be sure of what the direct or indirect consequences of these events in the moment were. I wish I could know, then I might not have given in.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But what if that's part of it? What if I'm supposed to give in and enjoy things every now and then? I mean, I believe that it's possible to succeed and live a full, fun life, but why do I keep failing even when I believe I'm working as much as is comfortable. I hate that I feel terrible when I fail, but that's the driving force that gets you to succeed, right?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm sure I'll figure it out at some point. Either I'll succeed at everything, or I'll accept some amount of imperfection in myself. I'm sure one of those is more likely than the other.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Oh, and spoiler alert, I've managed to tangent away from everything I <i>was</i> going to talk about. Hopefully this has been enlightening to whoever finds their eyes wandering over these pixles.
