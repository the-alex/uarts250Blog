                    <i style="font-size: 0.85em">In the spirit of exploring the creative process, I've decided to alter my creative approach in writting for a non-zero number of posts. The first of which will be this one. I've decided to make a first pass- a journal of what my thoughts on the first few days of school and my weekend. Essentially, I'm just going to let my mind wander. This is the only paragraph that will see proper editing.</i>

                        <strong><i>So</i></strong> recently I decided it was high time I start reading again. This resolution is mostly unrelated to the date- I know I've needed to begin extolling my knowledge from books again since Thanksgiving when I had a conversation with my step-father and his twin brother. Nick and Mark are intellectuals of the highest order- the type that deflect the title of genius with remarks like, "No, it's just our work ethic" and "I didn't invent calculus, I'm just good at it".
                    </p>
                    <strong><i>tangent:</i></strong><i> I'll revisit the reading thing after this</i>
                    
                    <p>
                        I think after hearing these lines for years I've come to believe their "work ethic" explanation. The concept is something that's caused a bit of dissonance inside me since it's inception, but I'll walk you through the philosophy.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote style="font-size: 1.25em">Everyone is capable of doing anything.</blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Pretty simple, right? Well, honestly, it's too simple. I had an disscussion turned disagreement turned argument with my step-mother that statement. You see, I believe that when we're in our early stages of learning, there's a lot of hand holding and soft gentle padding on the back when we fail to understand things. This is especially apparent in math. Many people encounter difficulty in that subject, as it can be counter intuitive and hard to map operations in math to things in the real world.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Counting apples is easy, but phase shifting a wave is a little more abstract. The problem comes when students are told this- "Some people are just better at this stuff than you." The catostrophic damage comes when that student finally says casually, "I'm just not good at math."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Woah, woah, woah. Back up. This is unacceptable. I will tell you right now. No one is bad at math. No one is bad at anything. And anyone can achieve everything. It's a matter of work ethic. I swear. I consider myself an example. Hear me out, and prepare to learn something.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        My stepmother was not a fan of hearing this all encompassing philosophy. "That's ridiculous- I would study economics in college for hours and hours and get nothign from it!" she argued. "True!", I returned. "But the series of events that prevented you from understanding economics started later than birth and sooner than the start of that class." And now for some conjecture supported by my experience with my stepmother.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                         It was in middle school, when she encountered the first difficult courses in her acadmeic career. There, when you failed and saw other succeed, she assumed it was because they were "smarter" than her. They just "got it" faster than she did. But what many students fail to realize is that if they rise to the challenge and see that understanding maths is a tangible goal early on, then they'll be less likely to give up as the maths get harder. You'll have forced yourself to understand exactly what your doing before you move on.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I think I'm tangenting too much, so I'll skip to the point. My argument with my stepmother forced me to rephrase my point into a less conscise, but seemingly more accurate phrase.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote style="font-size: 1.25em">There exists a spectrum of intelligence that all humans fall on and it ranges from Villiage Idiot to Genius.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The reality is this, nearly all of us fall somewhere in the 80% to 99% range on this spectrum of intelligence. The variation in "Smarts" is much smaller than anyone wants to admit. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What matters is this: <i>There is a negligable limit to your intelligence. Merely holding yourself to a higher standard and vowing to succeed will alone will allow you to achieve anything.</i>

                        I like to use the example of Edina Public High School, because it's where my stepfather went and their statistics are public. The school is very well funded and the teachers there have a unfied mission: all of our students are capable of going to the top teir of colleges in America.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                       And they're correct. Or at least they have been for the last fifty years. Class after class, these students go to the Ivy Leauges, the great public schools like Michigan, Virginia, and the UC system- as well as all manner of other incredible universities.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <i>"How are they able to do this!? Surely they must kick students who do poorly out to boost they're nunbers!"</i> - Nope. It's a public school. You can go there if you wish- for free.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <i>"It must be the funding! Edina is so wealthy- they must get special treatment of some kind to make them smart!"</i> - you're getting close, but you're proving my point. Given the correct environment, a student can demonstrate ability many people would percieve as "Genius" level. However, the school isn't spending money on iPads- and even if they were, they don't help. They just make getting school supplies slightly convenient. No, the real advancement comes from one simple place: the school's standard.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Every student is told they are capable of greatness, <i>and are then held to that standard.</i> This is what happened to me when I met my stepfather, Nick. He was the first to tell me that math wasn't hard. That anyone can do anything. That he himself, smart as he may seem (BS in Electrical Engineering and MS in Patent Law from NYU) wasn't a genius, but it was exclusively this standard that elevated him. It's all a matter of how much you want it- how much time you're willing to spend to reflect and improve on yourself.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Nick said I was better than a C student. So he asked me to try and get straight A's. I tried, and tried, and tried. In 9th grade, I studied for hours every night- making sure I understood the symbols on the page and the systems at play. I spent days reviewing for exams weeks ahead of time. I even remember one summer I worked every day to fill up the pages of an algebra 2 workbook because I knew I needed to master that before I went on to Trigonometry and Calculus. In order to avoid the community college I believed I was predestined for and make it to Michigan (and equally prestigious institutions of computer science) I needed to progress from my 1300 combined SAT score and get my GPA from the middle of the class to the top 90% of students who took the SAT and the top 8% of my school.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                       Sure enough, in three years of working- I achieved that. A 2170 on the SAT, a GPA of 3.8, and an acceptance letter to the University of Michigan. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I saw that all it took was work ethic that I didn't know I was capable of- that many people don't realize they have. I've carried this into college, and year after year, as subjects get harder and the worlkload grows, I grow with it to meet the challenge. Becasue I know that if I get a B, it's not because I can't. It's because while I was in the arboritum, someone else was in the library. While I was watching television, someone else was starting the project. It's becasue someone was working harder than I was.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        But naturally, there is a small problem. Everytime I fail, the answer for why is clear and the blame is pointed squarly at myself. The harsh reality of my philosophy is that if I fail, it's because I didn't want it enough. I made the wrong descisions. I recieved a C in EECS 281- one of the more difficult classes in the Computer Science major, and I blamed myself- and I was correct to do so. When my roommates threw parties, I'd want to be there. If a pretty girl was going to go out to dinner alone, I accompanied her. I still can't be sure of what the direct or indirect consequences of these events in the moment were. I wish I could know, then I might not have given in.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        But what if that's part of it? What if I'm supposed to give in and enjoy things every now and then? I mean, I believe that it's possible to succeed and live a full, fun life, but why do I keep failing even when I believe I'm working as much as is comfortable. I hate that I feel terrible when I fail, but that's the driving force that gets you to succeed, right?
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                       I'm sure I'll figure it out at some point. Either I'll succeed at everything, or I'll accept some amount of imperfection in myself. I'm sure one of those is more likely than the other. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Oh, and spoiler alert, I've managed to tangent away from everything I <i>was</i> going to talk about. Hopefully this has been enlightening to whoever finds their eyes wandering over these pixles.
